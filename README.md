# NfoForge

A powerful utility to create NFOs and upload assistant.

## Key Features

- Token system for advanced media file renaming.
- Integration with TMDB and IMDb for title parsing.
- Flexible Jinja-based template system for .NFO file generation.
- Screenshot generation and upload, including comparisons.
- Output file organization, saving .torrent and .NFO files to disk.
- Torrent cloning support for multi-tracker releases without re-generation.
- Duplicate release checker - checks trackers for duplicates pre-upload.
